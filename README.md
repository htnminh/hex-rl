## How to run

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate models


### GUI
Play a Hex game:
```bash
python hex_rl/tk_mainmenu.py
```

### CLI
Play a Hex game in PvP mode with board size 7x7:
```bash
python hex_rl/hex_cli.py play pvp --size 7
```

Show help command:
```bash
python hex_rl/hex_cli.py --help
```

## Notes

The project is implemented and tested on [Python 3.11.7](https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v3.11.7), and should work on newer releases.

All commands are tested on Windows. `python` should be replaced with `python3` on most Linux distributions.


## Developer notes
Install pylint and graphviz then run to visualize (sometimes pylint doesn't work well with anaconda, reinstalling pylint via pip is the current best resolution):
```
pyreverse hex_rl -s 1 -A -m y --colorized
dot -Tsvg classes.dot -o classes.svg
```

`requirements.txt` is generated by [`pipreqs`](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs).
